    <p>Use <b>IIT BHU Geo Web Portal</b> - a GIS based Portal on your computer, phone, or tablet, to explore and find more about your Smart Campus - IIT BHU.
        <br> Here's a guide to get you started using IIT BHU Geo Web Portal.
    <br> <br> As soon as the IIT BHU portal opens up, one can see a satellite view of the IIT BHU Campus. A road network or a route layer is also visible to the user. As soon as the user zooms in from the current view, different layers become visible alongwith corresponding labels associated with them. The layers indicate the features available within the IIT BHU Campus and are visible as per the scale visibility which has been defined for them.
    <br> <br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Grouped LayerList, Legend,  Query, Directions, Around Me, About this Portal and Share tools remain fixed on the bottom menu bar of the IIT BHU web portal, whereas Measurement, Print, Bookmark and Basemap Gallery tools are available on the right side of the screen. The Scale of the map is visible on the botton left corner and Zoom IN/OUT option is available on the left side of the screen.</p>
    <br>
    <a name="“Maps”" id="Maps"></a>
    <h2> <img src="./Maps Icon.PNG" width="30" height="32" border="2"> Basemap Gallery</h2> 

    <p> The Basemap Gallery tool provides a background of geographical context for the content you wish to display.
        <br>
        <br> You can change the map at any time and select the one you want by using this map gallery. Click on <strong>Basemap Gallery</strong> icon from the bottom right side of the portal. On the widget, click on one of the listed maps for it to load and serve as your preferred map.
        <br> You can select one of the following maps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Open Street Map </li>
        <li> Imagery </li>
        <li> Imagery with Labels </li>
        <li> Streets </li>
        <li> Topographic </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <br>
     <a name="“Legend”" id="Legend"></a>
    <h2> <img src="./Legends Icon.PNG" width="30" height="32" border="2"> Legend </h2>
    <p> It is important not only to view a map but also to make some sense out of it. A legend provides the map reader meaning of the symbols used to represent features on the map viz Departments, Hostels, Administrative, General Buildings and Grounds within the campus. 
<br>
<br>Click on <strong>Legend</strong> icon from the bottom menu bar on the portal. Now, look at the stylized shapes and symbols given on your map, you'll find out these shapes and symbols on legend with what they depict.
        <br>
        <br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The legend changes dynamically as per the scale of the map. The legend is visible if and only if the corresponding layer is visible on the map.
